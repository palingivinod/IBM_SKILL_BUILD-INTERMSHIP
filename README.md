## Technical Details

### Data Structure
Tasks are stored as objects with the following properties:
```javascript
{
  id: Date.now(),        // Unique identifier
  text: "Task description", 
  completed: false,      // Completion status
  timestamp: "ISO string" // When task was created
}
```

- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
